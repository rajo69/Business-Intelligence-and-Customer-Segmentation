# Automobile Sales Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of customer transaction data for an automobile manufacturer, covering various demographics and purchasing patterns. The objective is to extract actionable insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA), customer segmentation using clustering algorithms, and predictive modeling. These insights help businesses optimize their marketing strategies, loyalty programs, and dynamic pricing models to enhance profitability and customer retention.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following steps:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   Detailed examination of the dataset to uncover key trends, relationships, and insights into customer behavior and purchasing patterns.
   
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**  
   Ensuring the dataset is clean, consistent, and ready for further analysis by handling missing values, outliers, and transforming features for clustering and modeling.
   
3. **Customer Segmentation:**  
   Applying clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to perform RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value), identifying distinct customer groups for targeted marketing strategies.
   
4. **Predictive Modeling:**  
   Building machine learning models to predict dynamic pricing based on various factors such as quantity ordered, MSRP, and customer segmentation scores, assisting the business in optimizing its Order-to-Cash process.
   
5. **Visualization and Reporting:**  
   Creating insightful and interactive visualizations to communicate findings effectively, using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Dependencies
To run this project, the following Python libraries are required:
- **NumPy**  
- **Pandas**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **Scikit-learn**

## Data Source
The dataset used for this project is synthetic and available on Kaggle. You can download the data from the following link:
[Kaggle - Automobile Sales Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ddosad/auto-sales-data/data)

## Running the Project
1. Download the `A3_Data_Analysis_Project.ipynb` file and place it in the same folder as your dataset.
2. Open the `.ipynb` file using **Anaconda** or **Jupyter Notebook**.
3. Run each cell sequentially to execute the analysis, customer segmentation, and predictive modeling steps.

## Results & Insights
- **Customer Segmentation:** Segregated the customer base into multiple groups based on their value and loyalty, helping design loyalty schemes and improving customer acquisition strategies.
- **Dynamic Pricing Model:** Developed a machine learning model to predict dynamic pricing for products, automating the pricing process and optimizing business operations.
- **Visualization:** Generated meaningful visualizations to represent customer trends, pricing strategies, and model performance.

## Conclusion
This project successfully analyzed the sales data, providing valuable insights into customer behavior and product pricing. The predictive model for dynamic pricing is highly accurate, helping to automate and improve the business's Order-to-Cash process.
